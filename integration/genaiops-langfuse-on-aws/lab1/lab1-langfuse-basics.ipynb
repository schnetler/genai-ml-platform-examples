    "# Lab 1: Langfuse Tracing\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will learn how to use Langfuse tracing to log and analyze the execution of your LLM applications. The Langfuse supports self-hosted on AWS (this lab) and there is a [cloud version](https://cloud.langfuse.com/) available. [Tracing](https://langfuse.com/docs/tracing) in Langfuse is a way to log and analyze the execution of your LLM applications and following reference provides a detailed overview of the data model used. It is inspired by OpenTelemetry.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## [Traces and Observations](https://langfuse.com/docs/tracing-data-model)\n",
    "A trace typically represents a single request or operation. It contains the overall input and output of the function, as well as metadata about the request, such as the user, the session, and tags. Usually, a trace corresponds to a single api call of an application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each trace can contain multiple observations to log the individual steps of the execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Observations are of different types:\n",
    "    - Events are the basic building blocks. They are used to track discrete events in a trace.\n",
    "    - Spans represent durations of units of work in a trace.\n",
    "    - Generations are spans used to log generations of AI models. They contain additional attributes about the model, the prompt, and the completion. For generations, [token usage and costs](https://langfuse.com/docs/model-usage-and-cost) are automatically calculated.\n",
    "- Observations can be nested.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Trace and Observations](./images/trace-observation.png)\n",
    "![Trace and Observations UI](./images/trace-observation-ui.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## [Sessions](https://langfuse.com/docs/tracing-data-model)\n",
    "Optionally, traces can be grouped into sessions. Sessions are used to group traces that are part of the same user interaction. A common example is a thread in a chat interface.\n",
    "Please refer to the [Sessions documentation](https://langfuse.com/docs/sessions) to add sessions to your traces.\n",

    "\n",
    "Traces and observations can be evaluated using [scores](https://langfuse.com/docs/scores/overview). Scores are flexible objects that store evaluation metrics and can be:\n",
    "\n",

For example, you can create a chat bot that maintains a conversation over many turns and uses a persona or tone customization that is unique to your needs, such as a helpful technical support assistant.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the Converse API, you use the Converse or ConverseStream (for streaming responses) operations to send messages to a model. It is possible to use the existing base inference operations (InvokeModel or InvokeModelWithResponseStream) for conversation applications. However, we recommend using the Converse API as it provides consistent API, that works with all Amazon Bedrock models that support messages. This means you can write code once and use it with different models. Should a model have unique inference parameters, the Converse API also allows you to pass those unique parameters in a model specific structure.\n",

    "Multi-Modal Capabilities with Image Support\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern AI systems are increasingly adopting multi-modal capabilities, allowing them to process and understand different types of data inputs, including text, images, and audio. In this example, we demonstrate how Langfuse supports tracing for image-based inputs, which is particularly valuable for:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Image Analysis**: Interpreting and describing visual content\n",
    "2. **Visual Question Answering**: Answering questions based on image context\n",
    "3. **Document Processing**: Extracting information from scanned documents or images\n",
    "4. **Content Moderation**: Identifying inappropriate or sensitive visual content\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation uses a structured message format where the image URL is passed as part of the user prompt, enabling the model to process both textual queries and visual information simultaneously. This capability is especially useful in applications like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- E-commerce product recognition\n",
    "- Medical image analysis\n",
    "- Social media content understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "Langfuse's tracing capabilities extend to these multi-modal interactions, providing visibility into how the model processes and responds to image inputs, which is crucial for debugging and improving these complex systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this use case, we will pass images as part of the user prompt and the model will process both the text and the image and langfuse will trace the entire process."

    "### What is prompt management?\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt management is a systematic approach to storing, versioning and retrieving prompts in LLM applications. Key aspects of prompt management include version control, decoupling prompts from code, monitoring, logging and optimizing prompts as well as integrating prompts with the rest of your application and tool stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Langfuse to effectively **manage** and **version** your prompts. Langfuse prompt management is a Prompt **CMS** (Content Management System).\n",

    "\n",
    "Typical benefits of using a CMS apply here:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decoupling: deploy new prompts without redeploying your application.\n",
    "- Non-technical users can create and update prompts via Langfuse Console.\n",
    "- Quickly rollback to a previous version of a prompt.\n",
    "- Compare different prompt versions side-by-side.\n",
    "\n",
    "Platform benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Track performance of prompt versions in Langfuse Tracing.\n",
    "- Performance benefits compared to other implementations:\n",
    "\n",
    "-  No latency impact after first use of a prompt due to client-side caching and asynchronous cache refreshing.\n",
    "-  Support for text and chat prompts.\n",
    "-  Edit/manage via UI, SDKs, or API.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways you can create prompts in Langfuse:\n",
    "\n",
    "-  Langfuse Console\n",
