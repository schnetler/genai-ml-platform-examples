    "# Lab 3.2: LLM Security with Bedrock Guardrails\n",
    "In this section, we explain the concepts of LLM Security and AWS Bedrock Guardrails.LLM Security involves the measures and strategies adopted to protect sensitive data when using large language models.\n",
    "This includes safeguarding against the risks of exposing Personally Identifiable Information (PII), ensuring compliance with\n",
    "privacy standards, and mitigating potential security vulnerabilities such as prompt attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "AWS Bedrock Guardrails are a set of built-in controls within AWS Bedrock that help enforce security policies and best practices\n",
    "during generative AI workflows. They act as an additional layer of protection by regulating how models handle and process data,\n",
    "thereby preventing unintended data leakage and ensuring that the responses adhere to compliance and safety requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this context, Bedrock Guardrails play a pivotal role by complementing LLM Security, ensuring that even when advanced AI models\n",
    "are used, there is a robust mechanism in place to monitor, control, and secure sensitive information throughout the entire process.\n",
